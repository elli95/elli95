### Hi, my name is Elise Marie Hogsnes ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I am a structured and solution-oriented person who wants to learn more within front-end development and IT.

ðŸ”­ I am currently studying front-end development at Noroff - School of technology and digital media (graduating June 2024), while located in TÃ¸nsberg, Norway.  

ðŸ˜„ In my spare time, I like to play games, work with various crafts and occasionally take a walk in the forest, among other things. 

ðŸ“« If you want to contact me, you can reach me at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elise-marie-hogsnes-77b13b1aa/?original_referer=) or send me an email at [elise-marie.h@hotmail.com](mailto:elise-marie.h@hotmail.com)
