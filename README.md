### Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Elise Marie Hogsnes
ðŸ”­ I am currently studying front-end development at Noroff - School of technology and digital media, while located in TÃ¸nsberg, Norway. 

I am a structured and solution-oriented person who wants to learn more within front-end development and IT. ðŸŒ± 

In my spare time, I like to play games, work with various crafts and occasionally take a walk in the forest, among other things.
