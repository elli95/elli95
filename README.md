### Hi I'm Elise 👋
🔭 I am currently studying frontend development at Noroff - School of technology and digital media, while located in Tønsberg, Norway. 
In my spare time, I like to play games, work with various crafts and occasionally take a walk in the forest, among other things. 
I am a structured and solution-oriented person who wants to learn more within front-end development and IT. 🌱
