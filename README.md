## Hi, I'm Elise Marie Hogsnes 👋

🌱 I'm a passionate, structured, solution-oriented Front-end Developer from Tønsberg, Norway, that is always eager to learn. 

🔭 I recently graduated in front-end development from Noroff - School of Technology and Digital Media (June 2024), and is now looking for new endeavors.  

😄 Outside of coding, I enjoy playing games, engaging in crafts, taking walks in the forest, cooking, and skiing in the winter.
